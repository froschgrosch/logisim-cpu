# logisim-cpu

Some simple processors I built in Logisim-Evolution for practice. I might add some more in the future
Feel free to fork!

CPU1: A simple 8 bit cpu with some issues in the control logic. It is recommended to use the v6 version if you want to use the 8 bit cpu.

CPU2: A 16 bit machine with better sorted opcodes and generally improved components. Use this instead of CPU1 if you can
