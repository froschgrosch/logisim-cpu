# logisim-cpu

Some rather simple processors I built in [Logisim-Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) for practice. 
I might add some more things in the future.

Inspired by [Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard computer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU).

CPU1: *A simple 8 bit cpu with some issues in the control logic. It is recommended to use the v6 version if you want to use the 8 bit cpu.*

CPU2: *A 16 bit machine with better sorted opcodes and generally improved components.*
